For our training module, we used the first 2200 samples in the good and bad subfolders from the repos: https://github.com/paveyry/FaceDetection/tree/master/learning-tests. For our testing implemenation, the files are located within a dataset directory of each test (01,02,03,demo). All of these direcories are the same. These were partitioned from the idxupdate project-dataset. The samples were all renamed for organizational and file readin purposes. The enee408mim2txt was used to convert all the images to .txt to save both memory and computation time.
